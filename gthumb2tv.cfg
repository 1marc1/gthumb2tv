#TARGETDIR will contain subdirectories named after your catalogs (albums). The
#TARGETDIR variable is determined based on which library the user selects to
#update. This program uses the array TARGETDIRS to determine the directory
#which will contain the albums (and symlinks inside them). The first entry of
#the array is the directory to be used for the default library. The second
#entry is the name of a Library; the third entry is the directory name
#associated with that Library. The fourth entry will be the name of the next
#library, followed (fifth entry) by its associated directory, etc.
#Each subdirectory will contain symlinks to the actual photos (as specified by
#the RSYNCDIR variable). This directory needs to be at the same level as the
#directory specified by DSTRSYNCDIR. See fGENERATELINKTARGET for details.

#SORT000STYLE determines how to sort the albums in "000 Latest Catalogs".
#Possible values are "Edited" "AlphaTOP" and "AlphaBOTTOM".
# - "Edited" means the "Latest Catalogs" album will be filled with the last
#   $NUMCATS catalogs in the order that they were last edited.
# - "AlphaTOP" means the catalogs from the top of the alphabetically sorted
#   list of catalogs.
# - "AlphaBOTTOM" means the catalogs from the bottom of the alphabetically
#   sorted list of catalogs.
#There is also the SORT000ORDER variable, which determines the order in which
#the catalogs are processed.
#
#For example, I have $NUMCATS set to 3 and I have these catalogs:
#   995 (last edited 5 AUG 2016)
#   996 (last edited 27 JUL 2016)
#   997 (last edited 25 JUL 2016)
#   998 (last edited 1 AUG 2016)
#   999 (last edited 20 JUL 2016)
#Here are the results for the various options for the SORT000STYLE variable, in
#combination with the SORT000ORDER variable:
#                       "Ascending"           "Descending"
# - "Edited"          996 - 998 - 995       995 - 998 - 996
# - "AlphaTOP"        995 - 996 - 997       997 - 996 - 995
# - "AlphaBOTTOM"     997 - 998 - 999       999 - 998 - 997

#Note: the order of items inside the catalogs will remain chronological.
